What Are Views in Databricks?

A View in Databricks is a virtual table created from a SQL query.

👉 It does NOT store data physically.
👉 It only stores the SQL logic.
👉 Every time you query the view, Databricks re-runs the underlying query

Three Types of views available

1.Temporary Views
2.Global Temprorary Views
3.Persistent View (Regular SQL View)

--------------------1.Temporary View

Exists only in your current Spark session

Not visible to other users

Automatically disappears when the session ends

Example:
Python
df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_sales")
SQL

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW temp_sales AS
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE amount > 1000;





------------------2.Global Temporary View

Exists in a special database called global_temp

Visible across all notebooks in the same cluster/session

Disappears when the cluster shuts down
Ptyhon


Python
df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("global_sales")

SQL
SELECT * FROM global_temp.global_sales;

------------------3.Persistent View (Regular SQL View)

Stored in the Hive or Unity Catalog metastore

Survives cluster restarts

Visible to all users who have permissions

Behaves like a permanent virtual table


A Persisted View (also called Permanent View) is a SQL view that is stored permanently in the Metastore (Hive Metastore or Unity Catalog).

👉 It does not store data
👉 It stores only the SQL query definition
👉 It is available to all users who have permissions
👉 It survives cluster restarts


CREATE VIEW high_value_sales AS
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE amount > 5000;
