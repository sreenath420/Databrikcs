 what is widget in databricks

 In Databricks, a widget is an interface element that allows users to parameterize notebooks and interact with them dynamically. Widgets are typically used to build dynamic notebooks that can take inputs and modify their behavior based on user-provided values.

Types of Widgets in Databricks:

Text Widgets: Accept text input from the user.
Dropdown Widgets: Provide a list of predefined values for users to select from.
Combobox Widgets: Allow users to either select from a dropdown or input their own value.
Multiselect Widgets: Enable users to select multiple values from a list.
Common Use Cases:
Passing dynamic parameters to a notebook, such as file paths, dates, or other configuration settings.
Building reusable notebooks for tasks like ETL pipelines or analysis workflows.
